# LAB: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Compute Engine

## Objectives

In this lab you will learn how to perform the following tasks:
-Create google cloud virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.
-Create a compute engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.
-Connect between the two instances.
  
## Task 1:
Sign in using the right credentials to the GCP Console.

## Task2:
1.Create a virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform(GCP)Console.
  
    gcloud compute instances create my-vm-1 --machine type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" --subnet "default" --tags=http
 
    Add firewall rule for the tags that you have created above as shown below.

    gcloud compute firewall-rules create default-allow-http --direction=INGRESS --action=ALLOW --rules=tcp:80 --target-tags=http

## Task 3:
1.Create a virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

To display a list of all the zones in the region to which Qwiklabs assigned you, enter this partial command gcloud compute zones list | grep followed by the region that Qwiklabs or your instructor assigned you to.
Your completed command will look like this:

      gcloud compute zones list | grep us-central1

Select a zone that is different from the default zone set for you for this lab.

     gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b

Create the second virtual machine and name it my-vm-2 as per the command line specifications below.
     
     gcloud compute instances create my-vm-2 --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" --subnet "default"

3.Connect between the two instances.

  1.Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network:
    -Connect to my-vm-2 using ssh as shown below:

         gcloud compute ssh my-vm-2

    -Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network:

         ping -c 4 my-vm-1

    -Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1 from my-vm-2:

         ssh my-vm-1

    -At the command prompt on my-vm-1, install the Nginx web server:

         sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y

    -Use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server:

         sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html

    -Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the line just below the h1 header.Add text like this,and replace YOUR_NAME with your name:

         Hi from Anne

    -Press Ctrl+O and press Enter to save your edited file,then CTRL+X to exit the nano editor.

    -Confirm that the web server is serving your new page.At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:

         curl http://my-vm-1/
     -Result:
      The response will be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.

     -To exit the command prompt on my-vm-1,execute this command:

         exit

     -To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2, execute this command:

        curl http://my-vm-1/

       -Result: The response will again be the HTML source of the web server's home page,including your line of custom text.

   2.Now get the external IP of the my-vm-1 instance from this command:

        gcloud compute instances list --zone us-central1-a

   3.Copy and Paste the address of my-vm-1 into a new browser tab and hit enter.

     -Result: You should see your web server's home page,including your custom text.(Hi from Anne)
